            I am a recent graduate of Rowan University located in Glassboro, New Jersey with a degree in Computer
            Science. I'm experienced in
            languages such as Java, Python and C++/C, web frameworks such as Django and Bootstrap and mobile app
            development.
            <br><br>
            Recently, I've been actively working on developing my blog to share my projects and code repositories
            with others as well as mobile apps that are used by my coworkers and family members. When I'm not working
            on web and software development, I'm is maintaining/upgrading my 1991 Ford F-150, a truck that was once
            owned
            by my grandfather.
            <br><br>
            I currently reside in Southern New Jersey with my family and two dogs and enjoy the area and its
            benefits.
            <br>For questions, comments, or other inquiries I can be reached <a style="cursor: pointer;" class="times_info"
